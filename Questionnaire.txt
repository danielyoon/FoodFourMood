Colors and the mood it represents:

1. Red - Excited/Adventurous
2. Blue - Calm/Relaxed
3. Yellow - Imaginative
4. Green - Normal
5. Black - Stressed/Nervous/Tense
6. White - Bored/Frustrated
7. Purple - Clarity/Sensual
8. Brown - Restless
9. Orange - Daring/Stimulating (Part of red)
10. Gray - Anxious

Each question should be balanced, so that once a certain question is asked and is branched off into a question depending on
the color, they're able to always come back to white, or go deeper, or mesh with another color.

ie, first question would go towards red, and a red question would ask something like, "What would you do with the energy?"
Go hiking? (Would make it more red), Study/Work hard? (This would be red + yellow so orange?), Rest some more? (Blue answer,
so it'd be purple), or Do nothing (Results in red + white, which will be pink, but current mood = white, which means they lied
in the beginning about their mood. Energetic =/= do nothing).
